# Tumor-Driver-Analysis
This project provides a set of automated analysis scripts that integrate the dndscv tool to identify driver mutations in tumor genomes, detect copy number variations (CNVs) and structural variations (SVs) using Delly, and ultimately output mutation annotation results along with visual charts.
